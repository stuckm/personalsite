Bradie Bakes
This project is a recipe blog site made for Instagram baker Bradie Bakes. This project was unique as I wanted to be able to give Bradie the ability to edit and upload new content without having to learn any code. After some contemplation I decided to build this site using React, Gatsby.js and Netlify CMS. Integrating Netlify CMS and Gatsby would allow Bradie to login through the Netlify CMS portal and upload and change content as she pleased.
