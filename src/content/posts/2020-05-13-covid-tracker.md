I really enjoy taking raw data and finding a way to make that information accessible and easy to understand.
All of the COVID-19 data in this project came from the disease.sh COVID-19 data API. The project uses this real time data to give a visual representation of how COVID-19 is affecting each country around the world. The project was built using React and uses several different methods of visualizing data to give the user a good picture of how each country is being affected.
