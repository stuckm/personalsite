I enjoy making websites and spending time outdoors among other things. When I get the opportunity to explore, bike, hike or just enjoy the scenery I take it! I am an Arizona native and studied Web Development at Arizona State University. I am currently engaged to be married to my fianc√© Bradie and we like to bring our dog Kylo along with us on all our adventures. I am a spicy food connoisseur and love to put hot sauce on almost everything.
