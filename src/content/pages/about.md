I enjoy making websites and spending time outdoors. When I get the opportunity to explore, bike, hike or just enjoy the scenery I take it. I am an Arizona native and studied Web Development at Arizona State University. I am engaged to be married to my fianc√© Bradie and we like to bring our dog, Kylo along with us on all our adventures. I love learning about front-end technologies and experimenting with new libraries and frameworks.
