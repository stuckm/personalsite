## Hello!

My name is Michael and I am a Front-End Developer from Tempe, Arizona.
I recently graduated from Arizona State University majoring in Web Development. I have a passion for creating interactive web applications that are complex in nature but simple to understand and use. I am an Arizona native and enjoy spending time outdoors with my fianc√© Bradie and our dog Kylo. I love to explore and find cool new places and food to try.
